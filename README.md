# Phone-book
We can read phone contacts and load them into the system and write it into the output file. We can keep the information about each phone contact. We can parse the instruction from the instruction file and perform those instructions. We can manage the contact collection and perform instructions. All instructions mst be passed through .txt file using functions given below.
• add a new contact to the collection  
• delete existing contact from the collection  
• query contacts from the collection and display them on a readable report file.  
• save the entire phone book onto a readable result file.  
The system validates the correctness of input data like name, birthday, email, phone number, address, and then only if valid adds the contact to the system.

The phonebook can be run by executing the command "Comp contacts_1.txt instructions_1.txt results.txt reports.txt" where the samples for contacts_1.txt aand instructions_1.txt is given in the folder Contact Lists and Instructions, and the results and reports are generated on their own.
